#CHECKING CORRELATION FROM THE MOVIE DATASET
For this project,I used a movie dataset to try and see the correlation of different variables with the gross revenue.Normally it is noticed that a few things contribute to the success of a movie and in turn greater profits if the movie was a hit.I had a few guesses on what variables would correlate to the gross revenue from different movies in the dataset.I analyzed my data to confirm my findings.Below were the steps taken to execute using python:
Import libraries needed 
Import the dataset
Cleaning the data:My main focus for the movie dataset was looking for null values,checking the datatypes to change one for the budget column inorder to remove the unwanted decimal point,Making sure the year column matches with the year on the released dates column,Order my data by the gross revenue in descending order,check to see the dataset has no duplicates.
Perform a few visualizations using reg plot to confirm the correlation with the gross revenue
Formulate a correlation matrix and make it easier to illustrate which columns had a high correlation with the dataset
